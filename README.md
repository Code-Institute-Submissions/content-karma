## User Experience (UX)

  ### User stories

  User stories were created to help guide the design and implementation phases of the project and to ensure the needs of each stakeholder was understood.

  - #### First Time Visitor Goals

    - As a first time visitor:
      - I want to find out what services are offered.
      - I want to understand the cost of services.
      - I want to get a sense of how reputable to company is.
      - I want to know the benefits that content marketing can bring to my business.

  - #### Returning Visitor Goals

    - As a returning visitor:
      - I want to be able to get in contact quickly.
      - I want to check the staff and company's social media activity (may be linked to brand).

  - #### Business Owner Goals

    - As the business owner:
      - I want to generate business leads.

  ### Design
   - #### Wireframes
     - I created Wireframes to help me visualize the design for the site and have a template to use when I started to build the site sections.
       - Home Page Wireframe - [View](assets/images/readme-wireframes-desktop.png)
       - Mobile Wireframe - [View](assets/images/readme-wireframes-mobile.png)

  - #### Colour Scheme
    - The colour scheme was chosen to be calming and provide good contrast with the exception of the orange which was chosen to stand out (and because of it was a complimentary colour of the purple).
    <br><img src="assets/images/readme-colourscheme.png">

  - #### Typography
    - The choice to use a serif and sans-serif font together was made to provide greater visual separation between headings and body text while still providing maximum legibility at reduced font size.

  - Tested using a Firefox, Chrome, Web (GNOME WebKitGTK browser), an iPad and an iPhone SE for inconsistencies.

  ### Fixed Bugs

  Throughout the project a number of issue were identified from continual testing:

  - Design Decisions
    - The services and team/about section were swapped as it was decided that services should be below the page fold and were more important to page flow.
    - A page to help show why it was worth investing in content marketing was added to include a multimedia element and help educate the visitor and address and help ease any investment concerns.
    - Initial colours were based on the SVG images used on the site and its complimentary colour (orange). 
    White text against this background colour (#6c63ff / rgb(236, 236, 236)) failed the Google Chrome lighthouse contrast check so the colour scheme was reviewed to ensure better contrast.
  - Code
    - Initially the header was set to 100 viewport width but this caused an overflow issue. Units were changed to percentage to resolve this.

    - Google Chrome Lighthouse tools highlighted a performance issue caused by an image ratio. This was corrected to a 1:1 sizing ratio.
      - [Link to commit](https://github.com/ianmeigh/content-karma/commit/d756139dbf5275ae2a1464251a6c317ca73b151b)
    - The incorrect selector :nth-child() replaced with :nth-of-type() to allow elements to be placed  between the sections without affecting indexing and therefore section background colour. This was noticed when the section separator image was added between the hero and services sections.
      - [Link to commit](https://github.com/ianmeigh/content-karma/commit/1ec107368bfa9dbe339157a2feb8787d3ce89fec)
    - Google Chrome Lighthouse tools highlighted that all links which have no text content should have  aria-labels for accessibility so these were added.
      - [Link to commit](https://github.com/ianmeigh/content-karma/commit/3dc899c5343e576181c1bd1b8a42b6f0f7a6ad65)
    - Google Chrome Lighthouse tools highlighted multiple issues which were corrected as follows:
      - iframe's frameborder attribute is depreciated in HTML5. This was changed to use the CSS border property.
        - [Link to commit](https://github.com/ianmeigh/content-karma/commit/5c609fdcd656d92f7ca8905c58c8da30286ce750)
      - Vendor specific CSS properties needed to be removed to pass tests and the pointer-events and scroll-behavior property values I had used were not compliant.
        - Resolved with multiple commits:
          1. [Link to commit](https://github.com/ianmeigh/content-karma/commit/37c11f85e5780b181b8d18d8ac5dbf957bce29e0)

    - The SVG section separator was displaying with a gap in between the section above, stackoverflow provided the answer to add a negative margin to the image.
